## Bugs

- Django `DoesNotExist` at /book_service/ when trying to query a player**

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug01.png)

    - To fix this, I ensured that the query to fetch the player was correctly written and verified that the player exists in the database before attempting to fetch it. Specifically, I added error handling for the `DoesNotExist` exception to provide a more user-friendly message or redirect the user to a relevant page if the player does not exist.

- Django **`TypeError` at /admin_create_service/ when trying to create a service**

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug02.png)

    - To fix this, I checked the `Service` model definition to ensure that the field `name` exists and is correctly defined. I found that the `Service` model did not have a field named `name`. Therefore, I either corrected the field name in the model definition to match the expected keyword argument or updated the keyword argument in the view to match the actual field name in the `Service` model.


- Django `TemplateDoesNotExist` at /register/ when trying to load template

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug03.png)

    - To fix this, I ensured that the `registration/register.html` template exists in the correct directory. I verified the template path and created the missing template file in the `templates/registration/` directory if it was not already present. Additionally, I checked the `TEMPLATES` setting in `settings.py` to ensure it includes the correct directories.### GitHub.

- Django `Improper HTML rendering` at homepage when trying to display programs

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug04.png)

    - To fix this, I updated my template elements to include the `|safe` filter in Django to ensure that the HTML content is rendered correctly without escaping the HTML tags. This allowed the content to display as intended with the appropriate formatting and styling.

- Django `AttributeError` at /register/ when trying to access the profile attribute of a User object

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug05.png)

    - To fix this, I ensured that the `User` model has a related `Profile` model using a OneToOneField relationship. I verified that the `Profile` object is created whenever a `User` object is created. Additionally, I checked if the `User` object is being correctly referenced and accessed in the view or form where the error occurred.

- CSS `Improper checkbox rendering` for selecting services

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug06.png)

    - To fix this, I updated the CSS to ensure proper alignment and styling of the checkboxes and their labels. I added styles to adjust the margin, padding, and font size for better readability and visual appeal.

- Django `NameError` at /edit_booking/ when trying to access a URL that isn't mine

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug07.png)

    - To fix this, I imported `HttpResponseForbidden` in the `views.py` file and added a `django.messages.error` for user feedback.
