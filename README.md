## Project Description

Welcome to **BSC Hastedt Football Camp**, a comprehensive and engaging platform designed to enhance the football skills of young players. Our project is a dedicated hub for parents and guardians to manage their children's participation in various football training programs offered by BSC Hastedt.

The platform provides a seamless experience for booking services, managing player profiles, and tracking progress through personalized training schedules. With a focus on skill development, fitness training, and tactical strategies, our camp ensures a well-rounded approach to football education.

Parents can easily register, book services, and monitor their child's development, while administrators have robust tools to manage services and bookings efficiently. The platform is built with user-friendliness in mind, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.

Join us at BSC Hastedt Football Camp, where we nurture the next generation of football champions with dedication and excellence.

## UX

The design process for **BSC Hastedt Football Camp** focused on creating a user-friendly and accessible platform for parents, young players, and administrators. The primary goal was to ensure that users could easily navigate the site, book services, and manage player profiles. The interface was designed to be intuitive and responsive, providing a seamless experience across different devices. Special attention was given to accessibility, ensuring that the platform is usable by a wide range of users, including those with disabilities.

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme for the BSC Hastedt Football Camp project is inspired by the colors from the BSC Hastedt logo. The primary colors used throughout the site are:

- **Navy Blue (#04325F):** Used for headers, buttons, and key text elements to convey trust and professionalism.
- **Yellow (#FFEB00):** Used for accents, call-to-action buttons, and highlights to draw attention and create a vibrant, energetic feel.
- **White (#FFFFE5):** Used for backgrounds and secondary text to ensure readability and provide a clean, modern look.

These colors were chosen to reflect the identity and spirit of the BSC Hastedt Football Club, ensuring brand consistency and a cohesive visual experience for the users.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/00305e-ffffe5-1e1e1e-ffed00) to generate my colour palette.

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.


```python
class Service(models.Model):
    TRAININGS = (("skills", "Skills"), ("fitness", "Fitness"), ("tactics", "Tactics"), ("all", "All"))
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=False, blank=False, verbose_name="Service Title")
    focus = models.CharField(max_length=200, verbose_name="Service Focus")
    duration = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name="Service Duration")
    features = models.TextField(verbose_name="Service Features")
    training = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=TRAININGS, null=True, blank=True, verbose_name="Training Type")
    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='services/', blank=True, null=True, verbose_name="Service Image")

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

class Player(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='players')
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    age = models.IntegerField()
    gender = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('girl', 'Girl'), ('boy', 'Boy')])
    height = models.FloatField()
    pic = models.ImageField(upload_to='players/', blank=True, null=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"

class Booking(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, verbose_name="User")
    player = models.ForeignKey(Player, on_delete=models.CASCADE, verbose_name="Player")
    services = models.ManyToManyField(Service, verbose_name="Services")
    booking_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True, verbose_name="Booking Date")

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.user.username} - {self.player.first_name} {self.player.last_name} - {self.booking_date}"
```
I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- dragged the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/ibra8080/BSC-Hastedt-football-camp/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.


![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ibra8080/BSC-Hastedt-football-camp/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

- [Open Issues](https://github.com/ibra8080/BSC-Hastedt-football-camp/issues) [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/ibra8080/BSC-Hastedt-football-camp)](https://github.com/ibra8080/BSC-Hastedt-football-camp/issues)

    ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-open.png)

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/ibra8080/BSC-Hastedt-football-camp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/ibra8080/BSC-Hastedt-football-camp)](https://github.com/ibra8080/BSC-Hastedt-football-camp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

    ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-closed.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://hastedt-football-camp-9eb422a0dbcf.herokuapp.com).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `Python 3.12.2`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ibra8080/BSC-Hastedt-football-camp) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/ibra8080/BSC-Hastedt-football-camp.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.
